# Credit-Risk-Classification

A Python based approach, using logisitical regression models to be predict values of loan quality / status.

Analysis begins with extracting the loan_status variable from the dataframe and running instance of train_test_split

We create a logistic regression model, with a random state of 1 to ensure consistency with retesting of the data.

This LR model is then used to run a prediction using the X testing data to produce a y_pred value.

The y_pred value is then compared to the y_test data to serve as a comparison point between the modelâ€™s predictive abilities and the actual data.

Another logistic regression model is also created, but incorporates a random oversample model of the original testing data and resampled values for X and y.

Finally, we end on a comparison of the classification report data and, interpretting the results, we give our analysis of what modelis the "better" of the two.
